# Digit Recognition

## Description
This is a digit recognition project that trains a neural network to be able to recognize digits ranging from 0-9. It uses Tensorflow library to train the model. It uses softmax as loss function and uses a completely new dataset to check for overfitting.

## Information
The dataset used for the model is MNIST with an input image shape of 28x28. The algorithm employed is a simple neural network feeded the flattened image. The model is then evaluated against a new dataset.
### Accuracy
Training- 99.41%

Testing- 97.5%

Accuracy with new dataset- 99.29%\n
